    <h1> UNIT AND DIMENSION</h1>
    <p>Hello every one this is the first chapter of our syllabus. And before starting I want to tell you that this is
        the most easiest topic in class 11 physics.
        <br> Let the cource begins!!!
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This chapter also acts as a bridge between class 10 and 11. First of all we will learn some terminologies that we
        have already studied in class 10. <br>
        In our day to day surrounding we talks about the two types of quantities. <br><br>
        1.Non-Physical quantities: <br>The quantities that cannot be measured directly or indirectly are known as
        non-physical quantities. Eg: love,hate,etc. <br> <br>
        2. Physical quantities: <br> The quantities that can be measured directly and indirectly is known as physical
        quantities. <br>They are of two types:
        <br>a. Fundamental Quantities: The quantities that have its own identity and do not depends upon other are
        called fundamental quantities. <br>The fundamental quantities are listed below:

    <br>[NOTE: Among seven different fundamental quantities, mass,length,time are considered to be the basic
    quantities because they are mostly used in creating the derived quantities than other fundamental quantities.]
    <br><br>b. Derived quantities: The quantities that depends upon other quantities and cannot exist independently are
    called derived quantities. <br>Some of the derived quantities with their dimensions are listed below:
